*scratch* is a Vim plugin to provide Emacs-like scratch buffer.  You can write
anything in it, and you can also evaluate a part of the buffer as Vim script.
It is a temporary buffer and it is not related to a real file, so the content
of the buffer will be discarded when you quit Vim.  This buffer is useful when
you test a bit of script or other use.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.0 or later
